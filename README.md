As an Intern at Prodigy InfoTech, I have completed my fifth and last task i.e., DATA SCIENCE ----TASK 5.</br>

Task 5: Analyze traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. Visualize accident hotspots and contributing factors.</br>

In this task, I have done a detailed analysis of accidents happened in US countries by doing Data Visualization, using the 'US_Accidents_March23' dataset. Also done the Data Pre-processing for better performance of the model.
